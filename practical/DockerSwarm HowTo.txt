1. Download and install Docker Toolbox
   https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox

2. Follow Get Started tutorial here to create a Swarm:
   https://docs.docker.com/swarm/install-w-machine/
   - After this is done you should have at least 3 VMs created:
     . 1 x Swarm Master
     . 2 x Swarm Agents

3. Check your swarm environment (you should see all nodes here):
   docker info

3. Direct the swarm by issuing command:
   eval $(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)

4. Go to the directory where you put the docker-compose.yml file and:
   docker-compose up -d (to start silently)
   docker-compose scale www=4 (or other number higher than 1)

5. See the containers running (here you should see them spreading on your nodes, in my case they are created always on the same one):
   docker ps
